# MSC
(Release) Ontogeny for the "Morphological Source Code" in Python3 on contemporary consumer hardware. Functions as a quantized kernel for agentic motility, sharing foundational similarities with a Hilbert Space Kernel. It distinguishes itself by integrating an ADS/CFT-Noetherian-Grothendieck topos-invariant jet space for morphological derivatives.
